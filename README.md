# The Potential for Synthetic Data in Patient Data Analysis

The project consists of a prototype model that will predict whether a patient suffers from a single condition or multiple related conditions.

The patients in the prototype case are be those with at least one diabetes related diagnosis.

This is a starting point towards a more robust model that can analyze patients grouped by medical condition.

The data available to the model consists of vital signs and demographic info.
